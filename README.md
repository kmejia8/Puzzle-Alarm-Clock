# Puzzle-Alarm-Clock
A Raspberry Pi–based puzzle alarm clock that requires solving a random arithmetic problem to silence the alarm. The system uses a 16x2 I²C LCD to display equations, a 4x4 matrix keypad for user input, LEDs and a buzzer to simulate the alarm, and logic that increases buzzer intensity with each incorrect attempt.
